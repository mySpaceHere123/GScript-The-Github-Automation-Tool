# GScript-The-Github-Automation-Tool

GScript-The-Github-Automation-Tool is a Shell script created to help git/github users in creating and pushing files in a new github repository. One can easily overcome the pain due to the recent github update regarding access token using GScript. Do not repeat your commands (DRY), simply run the script.

## Installation

Download the main.sh file or instead clone the repository. Make sure git is already installed in your linux machine if you are a new Github user and here to try GScript.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ujjwall-R/GScript-The-Github-Automation-Tool.git
```

## Usage

Run the script and you will get to know how to dig deep. Use your access token as your password. Just generate and supply once.

```bash
cd GScript-The-Github-Automation-Tool
chmod 755 main.sh
./main.sh
```
